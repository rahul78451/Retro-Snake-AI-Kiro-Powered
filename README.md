🚀 Retro Snake with AI Advisor 🐍💻
========================
Retro Snake with AI Advisor is a modern twist on the classic snake game, where an AI advisor provides real-time guidance to help players navigate the game board and achieve high scores. 🚀

📖 Description
---------------
Retro Snake with AI Advisor is a static website project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience for players of all ages. The AI advisor uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the player's movements and provide suggestions on the best course of action to take. The game features a simple yet addictive gameplay mechanic, where the player controls a snake that must eat food pellets while avoiding obstacles and the boundaries of the game board.

The game is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a responsive and interactive user interface. The game board is rendered using the HTML5 canvas element, which provides a high level of control over the game's graphics and animation. The AI advisor is implemented using a machine learning library, which allows for easy integration and customization of the AI's behavior.

One of the key features of Retro Snake with AI Advisor is its ability to adapt to the player's skill level. The AI advisor can adjust its level of guidance and feedback based on the player's performance, providing more detailed suggestions for beginners and less guidance for experienced players. This makes the game accessible to a wide range of players, from casual gamers to hardcore enthusiasts. For example, the AI advisor can provide feedback on the player's movement patterns, suggesting alternative routes or strategies to improve their score.
